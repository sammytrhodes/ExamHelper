Hello. 
To start our program, you must first install java 8. 
Once Java 8 is installed, all you need to do is run the jar file.
Inside the root folder "ExamHelper" you will see another folder called "RunApp".
In order to run the program, just run the "ExamHelper.jar" file inside of "RunApp".
If you wish to move or copy the program, just copy the whole folder "RunApp", as it contains
the necessary libraries for ExamHelper to work.
